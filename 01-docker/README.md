Docker demo

Overview

To run this demo, you two choices: AWS or locally using VirtualBox and Vagrant.

Whether you choose AWS or VirtualBox, you also have another choice.  You can build everything "from scratch" starting with a plain base machine or you can use a pre-built image.

Vagrant
This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.




1. Setup the build machine.  We will use the build machine to create our docker build.
./Vagrant-build/setup.md

2. Run the up to make sure everything works
./Vagrant-build/run-app.md
