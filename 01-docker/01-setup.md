# Build machine setup 
[Back to ](README.md)

Overview
--------
In order to "dockerize" our application we need a machine with a few  prerequisites:
- we need the application itself
- we need Node to run application API
- we need Docker to create the image and run the container

We will execute these steps in a virtual machine running on <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> and we'll use <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> to manage our images and VMs.  <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> and <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> will need to be installed on your machine.
